Good evening, my friends! I’m Vera, and tonight, I'm here to talk about "AI and You". It's an interesting topic, here I would like to share some thoughts based on my personal experience.

**Before coming to start, let’s ask, what is AI? AI means artificial intelligence. But what is artificial intelligence? It is math calculations to mimic our mind thinking.** But what can they do? They focus on specific task, can process the large amount of data, capture the relationship which is hard to be discovered by human. Some of their ability already surpass the human level like Dalle in photo generation, chess player. Recently, one of the most popular ai is chatgpt. It allows us to have human-like conversation, much more like a chatbot. U can ask kinds of questions, like the relationship between families, *?? (add topic),* maybe u had ur speech modified by it. I see ur smile. 

Things have changed drastically. if we look to China where I was born. 4 decades ago, most people worked in manual labor, and there was no concept of a smart phone. But now when young people coming from universities, the same as we experienced, what kind of job was in our mind? We get used to having phone, knowing we gonna interecting with PC every day, aiming to joining an investor team to work on money fluctuations, or software platform, which would become next Alibaba. Basically, We have grown used to the convenience that technology brings, **but we all know that tech would not stop on the software milestone.**

However, I think, in this human-ai smart industry, there are three major effects that are hitting us massively. 

**First, those who cannot keep up will be left behind.** As new technologies continue to emerge, it will become increasingly important to have access to the latest technology to ensure that we have skills to succeed in a changing job market. However, if this cost is too high, this could create a further gap between those who can afford to access and those who cannot.This could disproportionately affect certain groups of people, such as lower-skilled workers who may struggle to find new employment opportunities. It could widen the existing economic gap between higher and lower-income individuals. So It is crucial to study this new skills, adapt to these changes,  to survive,  remain relevant and keep up in the fast-paced world. 

**Second, the definition of "diligence" or "hard-working" is being redefined.** If we focus on manually remembering every code package, postcode, or revenue number, it is not a wise direction. After adding AI on top, we can have access to a wiki knowledge base that's always available. This means we must work smarter, not harder. we need to develop a mindset that enables us to embrace the changes and challenges that come with it. Many of us are still adapting to this new reality, but I believe we have a longer way to go.

Actually that u may be suprised that I’m actually not a a human-ai activist and I don’t have bits running in my blood. I actually more care about what kind of life we want to reach? From software to smart world, it is a big step, right?  if we look at the automotive companies, they obviously have managed to get cars on the road for more than 100 years. But this step here requires so much new technology understanding data and the ability to innovate fast that it is a huge step forward for them. 

Anyways, we gonna get the tech companies well, those guys, they go wild. **They have made us already addicted to smartphones and media. So I'm sure they can make us addicted as well to other things, but they shy away from the liabilities because at the end of the day, this is a life and death product.** So we need to be careful about how we proceed with these advancements to ensure that they are safe and beneficial to everyone.

In conclusion, we have come a long way in a short amount of time. And I can only say that I'm really excited about what the future holds for us. At the same time, we need to consider a lot of issues, like  the potential for new technologies to exacerbate existing inequalities, the huge change on mindset, and the ethical implications of advanced AI. 

**Now Insteading of letting AI take over our lives,** we had better approach these challenges with a critical and thoughtful mindset, and work together to ensure that technology benefits everyone and doesn't leave anyone behind.
