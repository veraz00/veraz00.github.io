Ladies and Gentlemen,
Thank you for joining me today to reflect on our journey through technology in the 21st century. We're here to think about our continuous chase for innovation. Let me tell you a story that highlights the challenges we face.

In a city buzzing with innovation, there was a man named Sam. He grew up during the 4th industrial revolution, amazed by the emergence of Artificial Intelligence and the marvels of tech advancements. With a smartphone in hand and surrounded by screens monitoring every aspect of his life, Sam easily navigated the digital world.

Sam worked at Apple, helping design the iPhone to be lighter and thinner. Interestingly, as he strived for success, he noticed a trend: the more he focused on the iPhone's sleekness, the weaker his personal connections became.  Instead of having meaningful talks with his family and enjoying nature, he was busy making the phone lighter. This left him feeling empty. Sometimes, he has to train himself to be a cold robot, be good at math, not put any emotion to work and keep communicating with a cold pc. It seems it is the surviving skills in thie overtechniquqeized society, does not it? 

But Sam comes to an important question to ponder, Is his chasing progress worth sacrificing the essence of his humanity? If he had no choice, does he become the result and the cause of this over techniquelized society? 

Let me explain what's the overtechnilization here. We have great minds, but they're not always used where needed. Some advocate for technology's benefits, hoping to create a better world through these advancements. While this was true for electricity, cars, and smartphones, the additional value of some new technologies is decreasing, or threating. Maybe it's time to rethink our approach and reweight the priority of tech development.

We try to improve things, but nothing compares to what we naturally have. We build artificial environments for growing food, while we have land being used for offices. We obsess over fitness and diet, forgetting that people in the past didn't worry much about eating naturally. A lot of innovation on tracking health, or creating new medicines. Are we really get healthier as the innovation goes on? So, we must ask: Do we really need to push technology so hard now?

Back to Sam’s story: he didn't just ponder these thoughts. He started asking: How can we make society better, if tech is not the best choice now? In his quest for a more humane life, he realized the power of giving.

Sam's life changed one evening in a crowded food court. Instead of rushing for a meal, he saw a man sitting alone, looking tired. Sam approached him and offered more than money – he offered a real conversation. This act was more helpful to that man than suggesting a health-tracking app.  It's where we can jump out of being a cold tech robot and drive the society to be humanized.


Do things for people is not because who they are or what they do in return. A small act of generosity can help a connection beyond the digital world we're used to. It's how the world can be better. 

So, friends, as we consider technology's role in our lives, let's remember Sam's story. We should ask ourselves: What's the real goal of developing new technology now? To truly improve society, maybe we should start with kindness and generosity.

Thank You
