At Meta Connect 2023, three groundbreaking products have emerged: the mixed reality glass, the emu platform, and smart glasses. **Today, I'd like to delve into the realm of mixed reality**.

Mixed reality is a burgeoning industrial frontier that harnesses cutting-edge computer vision technology, paving the way for new research in 3D computer vision and simulated reality structures. It spans disciplines from mechanics to computer science and even the arts, making it a popular and innovative direction. **This allows us to leverage existing advancements while fostering the potential for further technical breakthroughs**.

However, after delving into its features, **a pressing question emerges: Why do we need it?** In the world of product slogans, one stands out: not just satisfying customer needs but opening new demands. In essence, while we may not inherently need it, such technology can influence us to consider it as fashionable, useful, and normal.

My skepticism about mixed reality, particularly in gaming, revolves around three key points:

1. **Threatening Real-Life Interactions**: By potentially diverting more of our fixed daily time towards these virtual experiences, we risk diminishing our time for humanized interactions and genuine connections. **The immersive nature of mixed reality could overshadow real-world engagement, impacting trust and enthusiasm among humans**.

2. **Resource Misallocation**: The talented minds working on mixed reality may be driven by financial incentives or survival instincts. However, is it ethical to prioritize financial gain over considering the broader societal impact? Redirecting these brilliant minds toward aspects that foster human generosity and kindness could contribute to a better world.

3. **Misguided Technological Development**: Pursuing fun without boundaries is a no-ending and stupid path. 

While some argue for the pleasure and excitement mixed reality offers, we must consider its impact on human isolation. Striking a balance between advantages and disadvantages is not a correct thinking method now, and **at present, just thinking about its potential harm is enough, which the harm can never be changed by advantages**. Balance thinking is only a publich trick employed by those tech companies.

In conclusion, my concerns may lean towards the pessimistic side regarding the current trajectory of innovation. While these technologies create captivating artificial worlds, we must question their necessity. **Our Earth is a unique and well-built habitat, and our focus should be on nurturing our humanity, caring for the Earth, and showing kindness to all life**, rather than becoming cold robots fixated on virtual realities with detructively pollute the earth.
