## Hello, 2024!

Hi, I'm **Vera Zeng**.<br>
I'm currently working at **[Monarch Tractor]** as a **computer vision Engineer**, where I'm building cool stuff and solving challenging problems. Please check my [resume] if you wish to know more about me. <br>
I'm involved in volunteer work and enjoy reading literature. I'm also a big fan of outdoor activities. <br>
So here I am, writing about life, work, and thoughts. <br>
